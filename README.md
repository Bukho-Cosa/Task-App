# **Task-App**
### An application where you can keep, edit and delete tasks you have to complete.

## *Webpage functionality:*
- The webpage opens on a greeter page with instructions.
- After the greeter page is the task app itself
- The task app has an input field for the tasks and a dummy task
- Once you've added a task you can set its date, cross it out, edit it or delete it.

## *Languages I used:*

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS  

<!--it would be cool if I could add a time, an alert and a level of urgency or something of the sort to this or a favourites, just something more-->
